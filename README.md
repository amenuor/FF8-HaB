Well, first of all I needed it :)
Want to know more? Read the section [Why Final Fantasy](#why-final-fantasy)!
Beside that, it had been some time I wanted to assess the level of splendor and magnificence reached by the open source community regarding mobile apps.
This progressive app has been developed using few hours during few nights by using the following freely accessible resources:

-Frontend coded in JavaScript using [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/).
Inspired by the great boilerplate from [btomashvili](https://github.com/btomashvili/react-redux-firebase-boilerplate)
-Images and data hosted on [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com).
-The nice slider controller, used to select the level you are interested in, was originally engineered by [davidchin](https://github.com/davidchin/react-input-range)
-See those nice [charts](http://www.chartjs.org/)? Have you noticed you can [swipe](https://github.com/oliviertassinari/react-swipeable-views) from one to the other, and back?
-Mobile apps based on the boilerplates from nabilfreeman for [Android](https://github.com/nabilfreeman/android-webview-boilerplate) and [iOS](https://github.com/nabilfreeman/ios-universal-webview-boilerplate).
-Further Frontend inspiration from the great people at [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [Codyhouse](http://codyhouse.co) (Truly amazing stuff!)
-Actual images, icons, and etc. come from [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com/), [CSSAuthor](http://www.cssauthor.com/mobile-app-ui-psd/), [FlatIcon](http://www.flaticon.com), and [FreebiesBug](http://freebiesbug.com/) more credits info at the [Credits](#credits) section.

#Why Final Fantasy?
------------

I was looking for an easy way to access some info on some FF8 characters on my mobile.
All the information I needed were out there, but they were really not presented in a mobile friendly way.
So, I got the data from one of the best site on the subject, [FinalFantasyKingdom](http://finalfantasykingdom.net/), and got the app together.

Why Final Fantasy?
Once upon a time Rusie Ren Ren asked me for my physical address on IRC.
I was young and foolish, I trusted him, and I gave him that information.
A couple of days later I received a copy of what I still consider the best game ever made: Final Fantasy 7.
Since then, I have always been addicted to that stuff!

But if FF7 is the best, why making an app on FF8?
Well... I was playing (again) FF8 when I decided to make the app :)
